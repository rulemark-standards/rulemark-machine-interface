 ## RuleMark v2.0 — The Sovereign Settlement Layer

RuleMark is not a signing tool. It is the settlement layer for digital truth.

In an era of infinite AI generation, the only scarce asset is verifiable reality.
RuleMark decouples trust from platforms and anchors it in cryptography.

We define who signs.
We define what is frozen.
Once verified, the record is irreversible.

A signature is not approval.
It is asset finality.

This turns data into machine-verifiable capital —
consumable by humans, institutions, and AI agents alike.
